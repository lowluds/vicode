# vicode

Build together. Deploy with proof.

vicode is a project-first workspace where builders publish projects, share progress, post needs, apply with proof, and message to collaborate.

## What vicode is

- A home for your project's story: the idea, the demo, the progress, and the asks.
- A place to find collaborators through real work: needs, proof-based applications, and project-scoped messaging.
- A workshop dashboard: high-signal, calm, and built for shipping.

## What vicode is not

- Not a forum.
- Not a job board.
- Not a social network optimized for engagement.

## Core loop

1. Publish a project
   - Link your repo (GitHub) and your demo.
   - Describe the vision, the current state, and what's next.

2. Share progress (updates)
   - Post milestones and progress notes.
   - Build trust by showing work in public.

3. Ask for help (needs)
   - Post a need: role, scope, and comp (paid/revshare/unpaid/bounty).
   - Keep collaboration attached to a real project.

4. Apply with proof
   - Applicants respond with proof links (shipped work, demos, repos).

5. Message and build
   - Coordinate inside project-scoped threads.

## Who it's for

- Indie devs, learners, solo builders
- Designers and makers shipping digital products
- Tool and template creators (kits)
- Builders looking for collaborators or proof-based opportunities
