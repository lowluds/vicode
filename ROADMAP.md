# Roadmap

Keep it simple and ship.

## Now (quality + coherence)

- Polish core flows: projects -> updates -> needs -> proof -> messages
- Reduce friction in auth and onboarding
- Improve consistency across routes, naming, and navigation

## Next (community flywheel)

- Better discovery of active builds and work requests
- Better sharing that looks great everywhere
- Stronger "project page" storytelling (without turning into a forum)

## Not planned (intentional)

- Generic forums
- Engagement farming mechanics (likes/reactions vanity loops)
- Infinite social feeds
