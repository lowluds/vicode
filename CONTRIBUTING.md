# Contributing

The core vicode application code is private right now, but contributions are still welcome:

- Bug reports
- UX feedback
- Feature requests
- Copy/clarity suggestions
- Repro steps + screenshots

## How to contribute

1. Search existing issues first.
2. Open a new issue with a clear title.
3. Use a short structure:
   - Context
   - Problem
   - Proposed solution
   - Alternatives considered (optional)

What makes a great issue:
- Tied to a real user outcome (ship faster, collaborate easier, show proof better)
- Minimal scope (smallest useful change)
