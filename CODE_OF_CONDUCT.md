# Code of Conduct

We're building a workshop, not a town square.

- Be respectful. Critique ideas, not people.
- Be constructive. If you disagree, propose an alternative.
- No harassment, hate speech, or doxxing.

Moderation: Maintainers may remove content or restrict participation to keep the community safe and builder-focused.
